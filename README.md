## How to Use This Repository
Each folder contains code implementations, explanations, and sometimes test cases or example outputs. Here’s how to navigate the repository:

1. **Lab Solutions**: Inside the `_l01` folder, you'll find the solutions to various lab exercises. These exercises focus on implementing basic data structures such as stacks, queues, and linked lists.
   
2. **Assignment Solutions**: The `_a01` folder contains more in-depth work, where you’ll see solutions to problems involving trees, graphs, sorting, and more. I’ve also included explanations and test cases where applicable.
   
3. **Midterm Exam**: The `_m` folder includes both the exam questions and my solutions. You’ll also find an explanation of my approach and the steps I followed to solve the problems.
   
4. **Final Exam**: The `e` folder contains the final exam questions and my solutions, along with any relevant notes on how to solve the problems efficiently.

## Technologies Used
The solutions in this repository are written in the following programming languages:
- Python

## Code Style
The code follows standard Wilfrid Laurier Univercity best practices and is commented to explain the logic behind key sections. I’ve aimed to write clean, modular, and efficient code. For example:
- Functions and variables are named descriptively.
- The code is organized into classes and functions to promote reusability.

## Test Cases
Some of the assignments and labs come with test cases to verify the correctness of the solutions. Test case outputs and input files are included in their respective folders.
